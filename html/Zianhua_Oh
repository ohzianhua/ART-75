            I wanted to create a museum space that allows a viewer to not only appreciate the art but also
            to enjoy the view of the nature outside without anyone looking back at them, that is why I 
            chose to make this museum elevated, and covered with windows. I am hoping to create a sense
            of peace and quiet. I included a number of domestic animals to replicate the sense of safety
            and peace that one would get at home.
